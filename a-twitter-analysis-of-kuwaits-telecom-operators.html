  <div class="article">
    <p>The purpose of this analysis is to look at the behavior of the 3 Kuwait-based telecommunications operators (Zain, STC, and Ooredoo) on Twitter over a 6 month period from January 2020 through to June 2020. 
All information is publicly available on Twitter.<br/><strong>If a plot is too small you can right click -&gt; view image.</strong>
<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Number of Tweets</h2>
<p><strong>@zainkuwait</strong>   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  14204<br/>
<strong>@stc_kwt </strong>   &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  12202<br/>
<strong>@ooredookuwait </strong>        &nbsp;1344</br></p>
<p>It is evident that Ooredoo is the least active on Twitter out of the 3.<br/><br/></p>
<h2>Word Clouds</h2>
<p>Below is the word cloud for all 3 telecom operators. We can see a clear difference between all 3:</p>
<p><center><h3>ZAIN</h3></center></p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/wc_zainkuwait.png"  width=100%></p>
<p>​   </p>
<p><center><h3>STC</h3></center></p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/wc_stc_kwt.png" width=100%></p>
<p>​   </p>
<p><center><h3>OOREDOO</h3></center></p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/wc_ooredookuwait.png" width=100%></p>
<ul>
<li>Zain and STC have the most interactions with customers.<ul>
<li>Typical customer service keywords are the most common (a higher percentage than Ooredoo).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ooredoo also has a lot of interactions with their customers. However, their pushing and marketing of their offers is of a higher percentage than Zain or STC.<ul>
<li>We know this because a lot of the prominent 'words' are numbers, signifying that they are tweeting about prices of their offers. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Typical offer keywords are more prominent: 5g, wifi, huwaei, etc..<br/><br/></li>
</ul>
<h2>Tweet Behavior Analysis</h2>
<p>We will explore the daily tweet behavior of each operator.</p>
<h3>Number of Tweets per Day</h3>
<p><img src='./articles/images/no_tweets_perday.png' width=100%></p>
<p>Zain and STC are showing similar tweeting behaviors in tweet volumes per day as well especially starting from the beginning of April 2020. Ooredoo lags behind in comparison. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Zain has spikes on 2 days where the volume of tweets were abnormally high.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First spike is at the end of January where there were some network issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second spike is on March 23<sup>rd</sup> where a decision was announced by all operators that calls will be free until April 20<sup>th</sup>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is the same chart with the number of tweets being scaled to log<sub>10</sub> to have a clearer comparison of the volume of tweets with Ooredoo.</p>

<h3>Hourly Tweet Trends</h3>
<p>Hourly volume of tweets over 6 months</p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/total_tweets_hrly.png"  width=100% /></p>
<p>Zain and STC are showing similar tweeting trends in the highlighted section above. 
Below is a similar graph segmented into months.</p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/total_tweets_periods_monthly_perhour_facet.png" width=100%;" /></p>
<h3>Periodic Tweets Throughout the Day: Monthly View</h3>
<p><img src="./articles/images/total_tweets_periods_monthly_facet.png" width=100% /></p>
<p>The highest volume of tweets were during the corona virus lock-down period which started in March 2020 and was gradually lifted in June. The definition of the periods shown in the graph above (hours listed are inclusive):</p>
<ul>
<li>Early morning: 7 AM - 9:59 AM</li>
<li>Late morning: 10 AM -12:59 PM</li>
<li>Early afternoon: 1 PM - 3:59 PM</li>
<li>Late afternoon: 4 PM - 6:59 PM</li>
<li>Early night: 7 PM - 9:59 PM</li>
<li>Late night: 10 PM - 12:59 AM</li>
<li>Early AM: 1 AM - 3:59 AM</li>
<li>Late AM: 4 AM - 6:59 AM</li>
</ul>
<h2>Customer Interactions</h2>
<p>A customer interaction is defined by any interaction with a customer or potential customer whether it is a complaint, feedback, query etc. 
The below plots show which telecom operator had the most interactions with their audiences.</p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/total_tweets_perctotal.png" width=100% /></p>
<p><img src="./articles/images/total_tweets_perctelco.png" width=100% /></p>
<p>These plots support what we saw at the beginning of the analysis with the word clouds: and that is that STC and Zain have a higher percentage of interaction with their audiences vs Ooredoo, who's tweets are more focused on marketing their offers and products.</p>
